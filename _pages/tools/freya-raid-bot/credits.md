# ðŸ’° Credits

**What are Credits used for?**

Credits serve as the in-app currency for FreyaRaidBot or any other White Labeled Bot powered by RaidSharks. Use them to pay for services across the ecosystem.\
(1 Credit = 20 USD)\
\
Currently admins can use them for:\
\
\- [Boosts](boost.md) (**One Boost** costs **0.5 Credit each**, so **1 Credit** will get you 2 **Boosts)**\
\- [Customization](customitization.md) (See pricing [here](https://docs.raidsharksbot.com/customization/customize-for-group#pricing-fits-every-budget))

For more details on each feature and how to use them, please follow the links above.
