# ⚔️Freya - Raid bot

#### Freya Raid Bot – Introduction

**Freya** is a powerful Telegram bot powered by RaidSharks, designed to help teams and communities raid important X (Twitter) tweets. It gamifies engagement with tweet data, leaderboards, and boosting options to reward users and enhance raids.

#### Key Features

* **Start Raids**: Use `/raid [tweet URL]` to begin sessions; track likes, reposts, replies, and views via the "SMASH IT" mini-app button.
* **Scoring System**: 4 points per reply, 3 per repost, 2 per view – audited post-raid and shown in "Raid Summary" and "Group Leaderboard" tabs.
* **Admin Commands**: `/settargets [number]`, `/togglemute`, `/togglelivestats`, `/settag [text]` (e.g., for custom tags like $SHARX), and more for customization.
* **Verification**: Simple DM-based Twitter account check – no authorization needed.
* **Extras**: Auto-mute chats, live stats, repost limits (`/setrepostcount`), and tweet suggestion finder (`/togglefinder`).

Freya is free, user-friendly, and perfect for crypto communities. Verify and join raids easily.\
