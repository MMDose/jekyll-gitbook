# Graphical Ads

### Pricing and Duration

Graphical Banner Ads in FreyaRaidBot starts for a very affordable rate 50 USD per 24 hours.\
\
Each "Slot" covers 24h and there is no "best" spot like on many other Telegram Bots. The ads can "rotate" within the bots and groups and the inbuilt algorithm makes sure, that ads are being displayed to as much different userÂ´s as possible, but it also makes sure, that it's displayed to the same user multiple times to increase brand recognition. There is a maximum of 3 Slots per day available so the amount of ads to rotate is limited. If youâ€™d like to book all available ad spots on a particular day, simply use the booking wizard and book a "premium" spot.

### ðŸŒŸ Premium

You can book Premium Ads â€“ meaning your ad will be shown exclusively on that particular day. ðŸ“…âœ¨

This reserves all available ad slots for a specific ad type for your project at once, making that day unavailable for others. ðŸš«

Important: Premium ads are only available as long as no other ad slot was booked on that day ðŸ›‘

### Where is my Ad shown?

FreyaÂ´s graphical animated ads are shown within the Mini Application of the free version of FreyaRaidBot and all other customized Bots which did not purchase AD-Free package.

\
<mark style="color:green;">FreyaÂ´s graphical ads are very effective and reach high Click-Through-Rates.</mark> This high CTR rate makes advertising with FreyaRaidBot very effective and cost-efficient.\
\
Because most Telegram bots are not able to gain valuable data of CTR rates, they solely focus on increasing impressions. FreyaRaidBot is far beyond that and focusses on high quality and attractive ad displays and an optimal CTR rate.

As a project owner, that is exactly what you are after!
