# Verification Troubleshooting

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note, that FreyaRaidBot needs to be verified with the Twitter (X) account you want to participate in raids with. There is no need to verify it with your projectÂ´s official main account.
{% endhint %}

Here is a short breakdown to prevent possible hiccups or misunderstandings.

* Follow the prompted Verification Account by clicking the blue button and follow on X.\
  Make sure you followed the right account.
* Enter your Twitter Handle twice and let us send you a verification link\ <mark style="color:red;">(Be sure to use the one beginning with @ and respect capital and non-capital letters)</mark>

{% hint style="danger" %}
Use your Twitter handle beginning with @, not your Twitter name.\
In the picture below it would be <mark style="color:orange;">@Bowski81</mark> in example
{% endhint %}
