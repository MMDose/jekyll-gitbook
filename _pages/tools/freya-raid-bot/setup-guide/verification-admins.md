# Verification (Admins)

<mark style="color:purple;">This section covers basic Information about Verifications for Admins and Group Owners.</mark> If you are a normal User, please jump to <mark style="color:green;">User Section.</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Freya does allow non-verified Users to participate in raids if set up correctly by admins.</mark> However, one of the main purposes of the Bot is building a leaderboard. To get the full potential, Users should verify their X Accounts.\
\ <mark style="color:yellow;">Please note, that you can choose to run the bot in</mark> [<mark style="color:blue;">"Verification-Only"</mark>](https://docs.raidsharksbot.com/raid-settings/verification-only) <mark style="color:yellow;">mode. If that mode is activated, non-verified users aren´t allowed to participate. On First Install, RaidSharksBot is set to allow users to participate without verification.</mark>

\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;herefore, Freya wants to verify, that a certain Telegram User has access to a certain Twitter (X) account._

\
☝&#xFE0F;_&#x54;his verification is optional and it´s not a login - There is no connection made between your Telegram and your Twitter Account! No passwords needed at all!_
{% endhint %}

To verify yourself with the bot, please follow these steps:

1. Open the WebApp by using [/raidsettings ](https://docs.raidsharksbot.com/quick-commands-guide/raidsettings)command within your group and click on the button "Adjust Settings"
2. It will open the WebApp and show an "Onboarding" screen on first contact, which gives you basic information about the bot.
3. Hit the blue "Verify" button on top right of the WebApp and follow the guide. <mark style="color:red;">Please note that there is no need to verify FreyaRaidBot with the official X Account of the project - just use your personal one.</mark>\ <mark style="color:yellow;">Please note that the Twitter Username is sensitive to upper case and lower case letters!</mark>
4. Done! You are now verified with FreyaRaidBot.\
   If you encountered any problems, please check [Verification Troubleshooting](https://docs.raidsharksbot.com/setup-guide/verification-troubleshooting).
