# ðŸš€ Boost

In Web3, attention is currency â€” and on X, itâ€™s survival.

Whether youâ€™re launching a new project, announcing a partnership, or pushing news, timing and visibility in crypto space are everythingâ€”and timing is absolutely critical. Most crypto services tie you down to strict agreements based on time or a set number of posts.\
\
**Boosted Raids** works differently: thereâ€™s no minimum usage, no fixed timeframe, and no binding commitments. Boosts are available instantlyâ€”whenever you need themâ€”and you can hold onto them until the perfect moment.

Thatâ€™s why we built **Boosted Raids** â€” a revolutionary way to drive real, targeted engagement from real users, in real time. No restrictions, no schedules, just powerful boosts exactly when you need them most.

What are Boosted Raids?

Boosted Raids are high-impact raids, that get your tweet in front of the most active and engaged accounts in the Web3 space â€” the SHARX Army.

This isnâ€™t an engagement group.

Itâ€™s not bots.

Itâ€™s not noise.

**Itâ€™s a coordinated strike of verified, crypto-native raiders trained to amplify your message with: Likes, Retweets & Comments.**

Freya Boost powers up your raids using 40+ verified X accounts (real users with blue ticks) to smash your posts with likes, reposts, comments and views.

Within minutes of Boosting a Raid, your post starts gaining traction â€” the kind of organic momentum that gets picked up by the algorithm and is seen across timelines.

### How It Works

{% hint style="success" %}
**Before using the Boost feature, please ensure that your** [**Profile Information**](https://docs.raidsharksbot.com/finley-ai/advanced/profile-information) **and** [**Verbal Settings**](https://docs.raidsharksbot.com/finley-ai/advanced/verbal-settings) **for** [**Finley AI**](https://docs.raidsharksbot.com/finley-ai) **are properly configured.**\
\
While Boost does not require [Finley AI](https://docs.raidsharksbot.com/finley-ai) to be active and used in your group, the settings you choose will directly influence the style, tone, and overall outcome of the Boost comments. As our Army does not know your project in detail, theyÂ´ll use AI to create comments based on your post content. So the more complex your content is, the better AI can react to it.

Verbal Settings let you customize how the SHARX Army comments your contentâ€”such as the tone, humor level, comment length, and the use of hashtags and cashtags. The more variation you set, the more human comments will look. Profile Information will make sure the army uses your Cash- and Hashtags etc.
