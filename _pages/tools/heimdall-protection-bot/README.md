### 🛡️ Heimdall — Global Guardian of Telegram

**Heimdall** is Odin Tools’ Telegram protection system — designed to keep communities safe from scams, spam, and malicious users.

#### 🌍 Global Protection Network

Heimdall is active in **19,000+ Telegram groups**, forming a connected defense layer across the ecosystem.\
When a user is banned in one Heimdall-protected group, the system automatically recognizes them as a threat and **bans them globally** across all other connected groups.

This shared defense means every new community that installs Heimdall instantly benefits from the protection and experience of thousands of others.

#### 📊 Global Statistics (Live Example)

* 👥 **Users Banned:** 900,425
* 🔒 **Permanently Banned:** 57,021
* 🤫 **Users Muted:** 429,703
* 🏰 **Protected Groups:** 19,572

These numbers update continuously as Heimdall identifies and neutralizes new threats.

#### ⚙️ What Heimdall Does

* **Auto-Detection:** Instantly detects spam, scam links, and bot behavior.
* **Global Ban Sync:** One ban = banned everywhere. Protects all groups instantly.
* **Mute & Timeout System:** Suspicious accounts can be temporarily restricted.
* **Zero Maintenance:** Once added to your group, Heimdall manages protection automatically.

#### 🚀 Why It Matters

Managing a Telegram community in crypto is tough — scams, airdrop bots, and fake accounts appear every day. Heimdall turns scattered groups into a **unified security network**, stopping bad actors before they can spread.

> Heimdall doesn’t just guard your group — he guards **every group**.
