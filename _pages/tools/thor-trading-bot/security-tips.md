# Security tips

### ⚡ Thor Safety Tip

The blockchain battlefield is a dark forest — fight smart, stay alert.\
Two golden rules for every warrior:

**1️⃣ Zero Trust**\
Never hand your keys to anyone or anything. Every “admin,” “bot,” or “plugin” asking for your private key is a trap.

**2️⃣ Validate Everything**\
Check twice before signing once. Make security a habit.

***

#### 🧠 Common Scams

**⚔️ Fake Admins in TG**\
No Thor or Odin admin will ever DM you first.\
Scammers mimic usernames and bios — always verify from the official channels.

**⚔️ Fake Groups**\
Never join random Telegram groups.\
Turn on:\
`Settings → Privacy & Security → Groups & Channels → “Nobody can add me.”`

**⚔️ Phishing Links & “Verification” Pages**\
Ignore any site asking for your wallet, phone, or password.\
If you didn’t request it — it’s bait.

**⚔️ Web3 Signature Traps**\
What you see = what you sign.\
Regularly check wallet approvals and revoke unknown permissions.\
Airdropped NFTs or “claim” sites can drain your SOL — avoid them.
