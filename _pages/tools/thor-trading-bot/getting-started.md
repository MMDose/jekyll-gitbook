# Getting started

**Step 1: Launch the Bot**

Open Thor Bot via the official link or through Telegram.

**Step 2: Fund Your Wallet**

Once you open Thor, it will display your wallet address. To start using it:

* **Send SOL** to this address.
* As soon as the deposit is confirmed on-chain, you'll be ready to trade.

You can view your balance anytime within the bot.

Thor makes it super flexible to locate the token you want to buy. Hereâ€™s how:

**1. Send a Contract Address (CA)**\
Just paste the contract address into the chat. Thor will recognize it and show the coin details instantly.

**2. Forward a BuyBot Message**\
Forward any message from another buy bot, and Thor will parse the CA and pull up the coin data.

**3. Share PumpFun or DexScreener Link**\
Paste a coin's link from trusted sources like PumpFun or DexScreener. Thor will auto-detect and give you the token preview.

**4. Type the Symbol**\
Not sure of the CA? Just type the token's symbol name, and Thor will search the most relevant tokens for you.
