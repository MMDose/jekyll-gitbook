Thor makes it super flexible to locate the token you want to buy. Here’s how:

**Send a Contract Address (CA)**\
Just paste the contract address into the chat. Thor will recognize it and show the coin details instantly.

**Forward a BuyBot Message**\
Forward any message from another buy bot, and Thor will parse the CA and pull up the coin data.

**Share PumpFun or DexScreener Link**\
Paste a coin's link from trusted sources like PumpFun or DexScreener. Thor will auto-detect and give you the token preview.

**Type the Symbol**\
Not sure of the CA? Just type the token's symbol name, and Thor will search the most relevant tokens for you.
