Want to buy instantly when you spot a new token? **AutoBuy** makes it possible.

**⚙️ How AutoBuy Works**

When enabled, Thor will:

* **Auto-execute a buy** as soon as you send or forward a CA (Contract Address), any link, or any kind of message that contains CA (buybot message works as well).&#x20;
* Skip the confirmation step
* Use your default wallet, buy amount, and priority fee settings

**✅ Setup Steps:**

1. Use `/autobuy` or go to settings.
2. Enable the toggle.
3. Configure your default buy parameters.

**Note:** Use this feature only if you're confident about the CA and your wallet balance.
