# Priority Fee Setup

To stay ahead of competitors in fast-moving markets, Thor supports setting a **priority fee**.

**üß† What is a Priority Fee?**

A priority fee is an additional tip to miners/validators that helps:

* **Speed up transaction confirmation**
* Get your trade in **before others** (especially during high traffic)

**‚öôÔ∏è How to Set It**

1. Go to settings and choose if you want to change the buy or sell Priority fees.
2. Choose a % or set a custom fee value.

Thor will now include the fee with every trade, giving your transactions an edge.
