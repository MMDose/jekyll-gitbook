# Priority Fee Setup

To stay ahead of competitors in fast-moving markets, Thor supports setting a **priority fee**.<br>

**🧠 What is a Priority Fee?**

A priority fee is an additional tip to miners/validators that helps:

* Speed up transaction confirmation
* Get your trade in before others (especially during high traffic)<br>

**⚙️ How to Set It**

Go to settings and choose if you want to change the buy or sell Priority fees.
