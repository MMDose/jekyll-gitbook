# Volume Bot

**Command:** `/volume_bot`

### What is Volume Bot?

The **Volume Bot** is designed to simulate trading activity by performing multiple **linked buy/sell transactions** across many wallets. It’s built to be **cheap, fast, and highly effective**.

***

### Available Pools

{% hint style="success" %}
<p align="center"><strong><code>PumpSwap, Raydium AMM, Raydium CPMM, Raydium CLMM, Raydium Launchpad, Meteora DLMM, DYN, DLMM2</code></strong></p>
{% endhint %}

***

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Minimum deposit is 1.5 SOL for first deposit, 1 SOL will be charged for whitelisting the CA for User. Then bot is free from services fees. Recharge as much as you want and run as much as you want!**
{% endhint %}

***

### ⚙️ Available Controls

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Start / Stop**

Start the bot manually. Stop it anytime when not needed, and **resume it instantly** when you're ready again.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Speed**

* Control how fast the bot sends transactions.
* Higher speed = more volume but faster balance consumption.
* Lower speed = more natural, slower burn.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Execution Mode**

**NEW: Random Execution Mode hides bot patterns by performing randomized trades.**

You can also define custom buy/sell ratios (e.g. 1:1, 3:2, 5:1).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Calculate Volume**

Use the built-in calculator to estimate the **approximate volume** your deposit will generate — based on the current pool and SOL price.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
