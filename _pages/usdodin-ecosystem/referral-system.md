# Referral System

The Referral Hall is a system where users can earn 8% of fees every time someone joins the ODIN Tools ecosystem using their unique referral link. Rewards are accumulated in a Bonus Wallet, ready to be withdrawn once you reach the threshold.

## How It Works

1\. Get Your Unique Link

Every warrior is given a unique referral link upon joining. This link allows you to invite others to use ODIN Tools

2\. Share the Link Across Realms

Share your link on social media, community groups, or directly with fellow enthusiasts in the crypto world

3\. Earn Rewards

When a referred user runs the bot, 8% of their service fee is credited to your Bonus Wallet

4\. Claim Your Rewards

Once your Bonus Wallet reaches 0.1 SOL, you can withdraw your treasure and use it for your next adventure

## Key Features

• Transparent Earnings: Track your referrals, bonus balance, and withdrawal history in real-time

• Low Threshold: Withdraw your earnings as soon as they reach 0.1 SOL

• Passive Income: Generate ongoing rewards for every referred user who continues to use ODIN Tools
