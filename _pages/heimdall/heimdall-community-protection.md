### 🛡 The Group Protection Bot

Trust is key to strong online communities. It keeps people connected and active. But scammers, shillers, and promoters damage it every day. They post spam, harmful content, and unsafe media that gets past filters. Manual moderation takes a lot of effort. It's exhausting, uneven, and hard to grow with.

Heimdall fixes this, completely free.
