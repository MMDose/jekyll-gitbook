# Revenue Share

At $ODIN, we're committed to creating a project that rewards our community and supports long-term growth. Our revenue share model is designed to ensure that everyone plays a role in the success of the ecosystem while continuously driving innovation and utility development.

\
**Revenue Allocation Breakdown**

* **8% to Top 10 Holders**: For now, this revenue share will be evenly distributed among the top 10 holders (excluding inner team wallets)
* **4% to Top 20 Holders**: For now, this revenue share will be evenly distributed among the top 11-20 holders (excluding inner team wallets)
* **10% to the Team**: A portion goes to the team to ensure continued development and progress. We’re in this for the long haul, and our team’s dedication drives the project forward
* **10% to Marketing Wallet**: To keep the project visible and growing, 10% of the revenue is allocated to marketing efforts, expanding the reach and awareness of $ODIN
* **10% for Burn & Buy Back**: This helps reduce supply and increase scarcity, which in turn boosts the value of the remaining tokens for holders

**Development-First Focus**

The remaining revenue goes straight into development. We’re focused on providing high-quality, high-performance utilities that deliver real value at an efficient price. Each utility we create is designed to stay ahead of the competition and provide our community with the best tools available.\
\
We’re not just thinking short-term. $ODIN is built to be a self-sustaining project, continually evolving and rewarding both our top holders and the community.&#x20;
