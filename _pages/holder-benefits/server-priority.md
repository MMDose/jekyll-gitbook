# Server Priority

As $ODIN’s momentum grows, demand for our tools and services is expected to rise significantly. \
With this growth, there’s potential for server congestion during peak activity.\
\
While we are scaling our server handling power to meet demand, occasional outages may still occur during periods of exceptional activity. To maintain performance and reward our strongest supporters -our loyal $ODIN holders - we are implementing a server priority system to ensure a seamless experience.\
\
Key Benefits for $ODIN Holders:

* **Priority Access**: During peak times, top $ODIN holders will have enhanced access to our servers, ensuring uninterrupted use of our tools
* **Enhanced Efficiency**: With preferential access and support, our holders can maximize our utility, even when demand is at its highest

This system ensures that our loyal $ODIN holders stay ahead, enjoying uninterrupted access to capitalize on everything $ODIN offers, even during moments of intense activity.
